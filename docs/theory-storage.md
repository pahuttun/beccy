# Background information of ZX Spectrum data storage

During the days, there were two flavors of storing data. You either used cassette player and cassette tapes or you had [Microdrive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Microdrive).

Cassette tapes is the path we are going to choose. Digital ones, of course.

## Storing and reading information from tapes

ZX Spectrum didn't have integrated cassette player and like other computers of that age, required you to operate the cassette player. If program would like to read or store information, it requested the user to press PLAY or REC key and then patiently waited so to happen.

Fuse, emulator of our choice, supports both the manual usage of virtual cassette, where you need to manually rewind, record and play cassettes, and virtual tape files, where you can skip most of the hassle.

## Different types of data

Without going to too much details, there were three different data types you could store to and read from cassettes.

Programs are the most obvious one. Optionally you could save the program in a way that it autostarts from specific line.

In addition to programs, you were able to store bytes and arrays.
